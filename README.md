# anti-phishing
Leeds Beckett University - Production Project 

This project aims to create an anti-phishing Google Chrome Extension. When a user uses Gmail,
Outlook.com, or live.com, it will alert them if the email link seems suspicious or dangerous.
JavaScript is the primary programming language when building this project which has been
previously taught in Advanced Web Engineering. The challenge of this project will be to learn
advanced JavaScript, which will work with Chrome extensions.
